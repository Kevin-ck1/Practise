# Figma

To create an auto layout - Frame, press => `Shift` + `A` 

To check item distance from other elements, select the item then press => `Alt`  + move the cursor to distance required

**Scale** - To scale an object, select the objects then change the pointer to the scale tool, then scale use it. Shortcut is the `K` key.

**Mask  Object** --  Draw the decided shape over the image, then click the shape an click the mask button at the top of the page i.e the half moon icon.

Note that in the layers panel, place the rectangle below the image.



**Background Blur** -- Create a rectangle with the desired dimensions, 

* For a simple white blur on a black background, use White as the fill and play with the opacity to the required level.
* Next on effects create a *layer blur*.
* On the brighteness icon next to the layer blur adjust the value to the required level of blur.
* Note For a shadow effect on an object, place the rectangle below the object in the layers panel.

* We can also blur a frame, in this case we place the rectangle above the object we want to blur, then ensure that we have no prior blur effect on the said rectangle, next we play with the opacity of the fill + the brightness of the blur. Note in this case we use the *background blur*, instead of the above layer blur.
